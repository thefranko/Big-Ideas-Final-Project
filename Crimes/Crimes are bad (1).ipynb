    "\n",
    "the dataset I chose to look at is called 'crime.csv' as it contains detailed arrest info from the Pittsburgh area in 2025. Each row in the set represents a single arrest and includes info such as the date and time of the arrest, the neighborhood where it happened, the type of offense, and whether the charge was a felony, misdemenor, or infraction. This data set specifally focuses on felony arrests."

    "# Explanation of the code (seen below)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses Python and the pandas library to analyze arrest data, which specifically focuses on felony cases. First the dataset is loaded from the csv file into a DataFrame called crime, where each row represents a single arrest with specific details. The dataset is then filtered to include only rows where the ArrestCharge_Felony_Misdemenor_Description column contains the word \"FELONY\" , using a case-insensitive search and ensuring that any weird values do not cause errors. To make the results easier to read, only the important columns are kept: Arrest_Date, Arrest_Time, Neighborhood, Type, Violation, and ArrestCharge_Felony_Misdemeanor_Description. Finally the first 20 rows of filtered rfelony data are displayed. "
