I had the Median age of death dataset. I had to find which neighborhood had the highest median age of death. The best neighborhood by my metric was Squirrel Hill South. Its median death age is 85.9, which is bascially 86. Living to 86 as a median is pretty good, as there's a good chance that there are people living longer. The top 5 are all in their 80s, with them tapering off to the 70s as you go down the list.

I had the fires dataset. I had to find which neighborhood had the least amount of large fires during the time period of 2013 to 2025. I found that Mount Oliver Borough had the least amount of fires at a total of 7 in the last twelve years. The dataset contained a total of 91 neighborhoods. The top five neighborhoods after Mount Oliver Borough are as follows: Regent Square (9 fires), East Carnegie (11 fires), Ridgemont (12 fires), Oakwood (13 fires).

# Combined: REGENT SQUARE
We decided that Regent Square was the best, it has low crime (2 Felonies) and fire rates (9 Fires) , and its death age (76.7) isn't too bad either. These data are pretty good, but its a shame that we couldn't find one that was clearly the best and was the best across all categories.
