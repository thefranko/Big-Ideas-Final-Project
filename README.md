In this project, our goal is to determine which neighborhoods in Pittsburgh are the best by determining which neighborhoods have the least amount of crime, fires and the highest median age at death.

- Description: This database talks about the median age of death in Allegheny county, sorted by neighborhood. It also can be sorted by black median age at death and white median age at death, but we did not look at that data in this project.

Fires: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/fire-incidents-in-city-of-pittsburgh/resource/8d76ac6b-5ae8-4428-82a4-043130d17b02

- Notebook: Fires
- Description: This database contains information on fires that have occured in Pittsburgh from Janurary 2013 to September 2025. The data had information on the neighborhoods each fire occured in; whichever neighborhoods had less fires since 2013 were more likely to be the best neighborhood.

#Overview
This project seeks to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh based off of Crime, Fire, and Death age data.
